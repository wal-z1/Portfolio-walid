- **Framework:** React
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS & Tailwind CSS
- **Animation:** Framer Motion

## Note here :

**Started with vanilla CSS for a raw, custom look, then layered on Tailwind CSS for polished styling and responsiveness. The project was later rebuilt using React and Vite to create a smooth, dynamic experience, with Framer Motion brought in for some slick animations.**
